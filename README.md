# Facial-Recognition-project

### Description
Facial Recognition and Detection software. The facial recognition aspect of the project allows an owner to use the software to differentiate between
a given face and others also provided to the program. The face detection aspect of the project is developed as a smaller aspect of the facial 
recognition project and is used to detect all of the faces present in a video, webcam, or picture provided to the program.

### Goal: 
To be used as a possible security measure to differentiate other intruding faces versus the owner's or authenticated members faces.
